Josh Reiss will present a summary of the current state of the art in Intelligent Music Production, highlighting current research directions and the implications of this technology. Brecht De Man will present some of his PhD results in perceptual evaluation of music production as he attempts to understand how mix engineers carry out their work. Further to this, Alex Wilson was a previous C4DM visiting student for six months, and will be presenting his recently publishing work from Sound and Music Computing Conference, in navigating the mix space.
