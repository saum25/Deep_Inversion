The <b>[18th International Society for Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR 2017) Conference](https://ismir2017.smcnus.org)</b> took place from 23 - 27 October in Suzhou, China. ISMIR is a world-leading research conference that focuses on the processing, search, synthesis and modelling of musical data. In this highly-interdisciplinary annual conference researchers from academia and industry present their latest research, demos and ideas around the central theme of ‘music’.

Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), through its Centre for Digital Music (C4DM) has been a regular participant to the conference, publishing several high impact papers in the recent years. This year too C4DM had a strong presence with participations both at the organisational and at the research programme level.

On day two of the conference Prof. Elaine Chew, professor of Digital Media at QMUL and member of C4DM gave a <b>keynote</b> talk on [“Structures: Performed, Perceived and Constructed”](https://ismir2017.smcnus.org/keynotes/).

During the week C4DM researchers presented (oral or poster) the following <b>full length papers</b>:
